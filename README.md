# TSP Simulated Annealing
Run main.py to start the SA process for various Markov Chain lengths (1,2,5,10,100,1000,5000,10000,20000 and 50000) 100 times, it stores the last value in the chain and the lowest value in the chain in a .csv file. The .csv file can be used to calculate the mean and standard deviation.
The SA algorithm makes use of several functions which can all be found in the helperfunctions folder.
